# State of the project
I won't be working on it anytime soon. There is no reason to truly continue the development.

# teapot - A programming language
Teapot is a simple C-like programming language mainly aiming for compatibility with C code/headers and memory safety, also including some modern features like first class functions, anonymous functions, and lambda functions, interfaces and other stuff.
This project is named teapot because hellory4n asked for that. That's all.
